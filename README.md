Homework 5 - What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

Pyber Ride SharingÂ¶
Analysis
* We can observe that ride sharing is more popular in Urban cities. This can be determined by the large number of drivers within that category type. Also, the fare rate range is almost at a standard rate and in general it just seems to have the most people.
* I am also able confirm that all of the cities that are considered to be in the suburban category are the 2nd most popular for pyber ride sharing. This observation can be gathered from either one of the generated graphs. However, if we look at the bubble chart, we can determine that there's a trend on the average fair rate and number of rides. This is most likely happening because of the daily commuters that live in the outskirts of the city and consider this service as an option to get to work every day.
* The rate and number of rides available for rural areas is limited because of the large distance between those cities and all of the other ones close to the city. The rate per day is higher and this could be due to the limited number of drivers and also the limited number of drivers who are willing to drive the distance.
